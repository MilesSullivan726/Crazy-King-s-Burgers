- Innovation outside of existing tropes

Main innovations are artstyle and tone. Our game's inspiration, Five Nights at Freddy's, is a horror game with a dark tone. We want to make a more cartoony and silly 
game.

- Why are we doing this

While the game is still technically a horror game (our inspiration is a horror game), I think making the game more cartoony,
goofy, and fun will fit well with this class. What I mean by this is that this class has had an emphasis on non-violence and making types of games we might not have 
otherwise (like story heavy games). While our group is excited to make this type of game, I think making it more cartoony and fun both fits well with this class
as well as helps our game stand out.

- What we hope to accomplish

We hope to stand out from both Five Nights at Freddy's and its many fangames but going for a very different tone and artstyle. I know that artwork alone (especially
if you choose good cover art) can help a game's popularity immensely, so I think by going for a 1920's cartoon style gives our game both a unique style as well as
tone.
